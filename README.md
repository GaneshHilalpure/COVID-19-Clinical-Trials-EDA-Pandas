# COVID-19-Clinical-Trials-EDA-Pandas
The COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA Using Pandas project aims to analyze and extract insights from clinical trial datasets related to COVID-19. The project involves data collection from sources such as ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO trials database, or Kaggle, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in trial phases, locations, sponsors, intervention types, and trial statuses (e.g., completed, recruiting, or terminated). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to uncover patterns in the distribution of trials across countries, the effectiveness of different intervention types such as vaccines and drugs, and the timeline of trial progress. Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn will provide graphical representations of key findings, such as bar charts for sponsor distributions, line charts for time-series trends, and heatmaps for correlations. The project aims to generate meaningful insights that can contribute to understanding the global research response to COVID-19 and assist policymakers and researchers in making data-driven decisions.
